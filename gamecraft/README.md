# Game Craft
GameCraft is a games jam event designed around building the gaming community. 
We aim to create events which allow game-makers to meet, share ideas, have fun, compete for prizes and most importantly make games!

Every team had 10 hours to build a game about "Wrath of Kitty". 

My team, Rafael Taboada [https://www.linkedin.com/pub/rafael-taboada-siles/64/a12/897] and myself finished in 3rd place.
